                <br>
                Apparently, the sand came originaly from Ash Twin, although it is not safe to say.

                <p>This planet is where the nomai from one of the scape pods
                    set their most advanced settlement.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The only problem was, of course, the sand, which often made it difficult
                    for them to move around the planet.
                </p>
                <img src="img/ember_back.png" alt="">
                <p>The surface of the planet is hot enough to kill anything on it, but under
                    it, the air is fresher, and it is reasonably confortable to live.
                </p>
                <img src="img/sunless_city.jfif" alt="">
                <p>And so, they built the Sunless City inside a cave system in the north
                    hemisphere of the planet.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There, they built the High Energy Lab.
                </p>
                <img src="img/high_energy.jpg" alt="">
                <p>There, they achieved the creation of artificial black holes and white holes
                    in order to generate vasts amounts of energy, in addition to gain the technology
                    to warp travel.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    These two warp cores are home to compressed white and black holes
                </p>
                <img src="img/warp_core.png" alt="">
            </article>
            <article class="ash">
                <h2 class="planet_h2 ash">ASH TWIN</h2>
                <p>This planet is where the nomai decided to build the warp towers
                    to teleport instantly to any of the other important locations for
                    their projects
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The main problem, as in Ember Twin, was the sand, which only made the building
                    proccess harder
                </p>
                <img src="img/towers.webp" alt="">
                <p>These towers, each representing their designated warp location, were carved out of
                    rock, and contained a black hole warp core to suck the traveler when they
                    were on the warp platform and the tower aligned with it's destination core.
                </p>
                <img src="img/platforms.webp" alt="">
                <p>These platforms, black hole and white hole, correspondingly, would be
                    tangled together with nomai technology, meaning that they would only pair between
                    them.
                </p>
                <img src="img/station.webp" alt="">
                <p>The nomai also created a station that would orbit the sun awating a signal
                    to fire and destroy it.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This station is a marvel of engineering, but only the most expert pilots can
                    board it unless the Sun Tower is used to warp there.
